# DockerDashboard

An experiment in the use of Typescript with React, along with Express, Webpack, and Socket.io. The basic dashboard shows a list of both running and stopped Docker containers, with the option to start up new containers from pre-existing local Docker images. The app uses Bootstrap for styling.

To get this up and running, follow these steps:

1) cd DockerDashboard
2) npm install
3) npm run start-dev
